This project provides a comprehensive First Person Controller for Unity, featuring smooth character movement, camera controls, headbobbing animation, and immersive sound effects. Whether you're creating a first-person exploration game or an action-packed adventure, this controller will serve as a solid foundation for your player character's movement and interaction.

## Features

1. **Walking and Running:** The controller allows players to move at different speeds. Walking for a slower, more cautious pace, and running for quick escapes or intense moments.

2. **Crouching:** Players can crouch to reduce their height, enabling them to sneak past enemies or access tight spaces.

3. **Camera Movement:** The controller includes smooth and responsive camera movement, giving players a seamless first-person view as they explore the game world.

4. **Headbobbing:** To add a sense of realism and immersion, the controller comes with headbobbing animation. When the player walks or runs, the camera will subtly bob up and down, mimicking natural human movement.

5. **Sound Effects:** The controller integrates sound effects for footsteps, crouching, and running, enhancing the overall gaming experience.
6. **Dynamic FOV:** The controller implements a dynamic Field of View (FOV) feature. The FOV will automatically adjust based on the player's actions, such as sprinting or walking, to provide a more immersive and realistic view of the game world, enhancing the player's sense of speed and spatial awareness.
